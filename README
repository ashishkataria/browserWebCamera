Project goal is to facilitate users to access built-in webcams or connected USB webcams directly from web page.
It's a web based  i.e. Java Applet web embedded.
User is able to capture, crop and save images from a live streaming (all in web page) to his PC or to the configured remote server.

No Need to register or copy any DLL's at user side. I have Integrated class loader to load classes, native libraries and resources by itself.
Added prominent Live image cropping feature.
